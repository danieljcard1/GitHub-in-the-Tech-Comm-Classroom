# Tech Comm Project Implementation

***This group project will be the basis of our usability test and report, which you will write individually.***


Step 1. Each student will make an initial project pitch and attempt to recruit a team interested in pursuing your project. (3-5 students)  

Step 2. Once you have formed a team, your team will meet with me to present an initial concept presentation on the assigned day/time. Your group will walk me through your project plan using the [Elevator Pitch Generator template](https://github.com/Pitt-Fuego/elevator-pitch-generator)

Step 3. Start your sprint (2 week making period, 2-3 scrums per week)

Step 4. Open a Github repository. Open a GitHub project page Kanban board.

Step 5. Assign roles and specific tasks at each scrum.  

a) Get designing.

b.) Get building. Frame your architecture in a manner encourages long tail contributions.

c.) Get testing. Design, Test. Design, Test.

d.) Get writing the docs!  Use Markdown to start a README giving users and collaborators important instructions, project history, version history, etc. Establish a license, Q&A or wiki, inclusivity statement, and other documents to facilitate a fair and equitable writing infrastructure.

 Step 6. Release and present deliverables (GitHub repository and project deliverable) - Adapt, augment content from your initial elevator pitch presentation for your deliverable presentation. (See more information on your presentation below.)


##Style Expectations

****As you polish your deliverables…remember the conventions of design and technical writing we have been learning in this class.

-clearly organize content
-use strong topic sentences
-use language to guide reader through paragraph content
-use active voice
-use strong verbs
-place modifiers close to the word it modifies
-write concisely


##Establish Roles and Tasks
(this will vary and change depending on tasks - go with the flow )

Developers - Write back-end code and manage GitHub contributions.

Content, Doc Writers  -  Write the docs and other content. Build and maintain writing infrastructure. Ensure Read Me and licensing are clear. Make videos and promos if necessary. Build an information website if necessary. Establish Style Page. Establish a Q&A page or Wiki. Establish inclusive/collaborative documents. Document job responsibilities. Revise project pitch to align with changing product.

UI/UX Designers - Develop UI and UX interface, considers users, usability, accessibility, scenarios. Test. Test. Test. Possibly, build initial visual/concept prototype, architecture in XD or Sketch (It's easy to learn and possibly something you should think about adding to your quiver. Here is my [XD tutorial](https://youtu.be/Fxr-sPLadIY).

Be mindful of individual and group dynamics - Remember The 7 Habits - we will be completing mid-project surveys on your individual and group performance and you will each write a summative reflection on this topic.



##Project Presentation  

After completing your sprint, your group will present your deliverables to the class - submit a link to your GitHub project repository and present your work to the class using your adapted/augmented elevator pitch.

In your project presentation, focus on the following:

1. Conjecture - What’s the problem? What did you make?
2. Definition - What is it exactly? How did you make it?  What were your group roles, sprint methods and organizational practices (scrums, trill, communication), , etc? What project architecture did you incorporate to support further development? (GitHub Repository, License, README, Q&A, other content to support/explain further development)
3. Quality - So.why is this project/product important?

4. Moving forward, what needs to happen? What's next? Why next? How next?
SUBMIT

Submit project links including links to your Git Hub repository, final presentation, and your project deliverable.
