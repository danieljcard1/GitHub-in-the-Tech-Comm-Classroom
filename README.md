#Writing Infrastructures
Getting Started with GitHub in the Tech Comm Classroom

This session includes ASL interpretation and CART captioning.
Access CART captions at https://www.streamtext.net/player?event=C4.
Pin ASL interpreters’ videos: in Speaker View, hover your mouse over the interpreter’s video, click the three dots (...), then select Pin.
Click “Ask for Help” in the meeting controls if you need assistance accessing these services.


## Workshop Goals
Learn...

* why a modicum of code literacy is essential for Tech Comm educators

* how to scaffold code literacy learning using GitHub

* how to use GitHub Pages, Git UIs, and GitHub workflows

## Workshop Activities
Samantha Whelpley and Stephen Quigley

**Method #1 [Forked or InterRepository Collaboration](Method_1_InterRepository_or_Forked_Collaboration)**

(Fork a repository, create your own version while contributing to the base repository upstream.)  

**Method #2 [IntraRepository Collaboration](Method_2_IntraRepository_Collaboration.md) (Best for small group workflow)** 

(Add collaborators, start a GitHub Project kanban board, assign scrum tasks, clone repository using GitHub desktop Git UI, make edits, resolve conflicts, commit changes, merge changes.)


## Best Practices for GitHub Group Work

**for teachers...**

* scaffold learning building code literacy into the everyday activities
* let students take control
* encourage agile project management and product development methods
* provide examples
* provide resources, not answers
* design for inclusivity


**for students**

* use GitHub desktop UI or learn Git (merely uploading files overwrites others' work)
* assign roles
* distribute specific tasks
* write clear comments
* make pull requests specific to task
* designate a merge master / or set commit privileges to repository owner
* don't sit...commit - make pull requests often / push requests oftener.

## GitHub / Code Resources

[GitHub Guides](https://guides.github.com) - an excellent set of tutorials for GitHub learning.

[Open Fuego](https://open-fuego.github.io/Open-Fuego-Coding-Tools/) - code tools designed to support the things we are already doing in our classroom.

[W3](https://www.w3schools.com) - a wide range of code reference, tutorials, and a sandbox that allows you to play with code.

[Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com) - Code questions and aggregated answers.

[Sample Developer Team Workflow](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) - a decade-old branching model

[GitHub Accessibility](https://government.github.com/accessibility/) - view accessibility issues working with GitHub.
