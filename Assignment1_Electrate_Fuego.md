# Electrate Fuego

Hello, maker! Welcome to the Electrate Fuego web design tutorial. I'm glad we crossed paths â€“ for this might be a real intersection on your way to becoming. I use this document in my Technical Communications classes at the University of Pittsburgh to teach my students a little bit about code literacy, computer science, and something called "electracy." Just follow along with comments like this one, and you'll make a really cool web document that not only introduces you to the other people on their own paths, but will help you process how different discourse communities in your life have contributed to your arrival in this space, virtual and actual, and how they contribute to where you're going.

In this doc, you'll work through Gregory Ulmer's discourses of career, family, entertainment, community, and schooling (_Internet Invention From Literacy to Electracy_, 2002.) In Ulmer's text, he elides community and schooling into one category, but for our purposes I have separated them. Ulmer's theory of electracy helps makes sense of how we find/construct meaning and connect with others rhetorically in a media rich ecology. Ulmer uses analogy to define electracy, explaining that "electracy is to digital media what literacy is to print."

Before we get going I would like to give a shout-out to my research buddy Shauna Chung, who helped me develop the original Ulmerian framework we will be following in this document. Are you ready to get started?

Peace and love only, Stephen Quigley, University of Pittsburgh 2020

## Get started!

1. Go to the [Electrate Fuego Repository](https://github.com/Open-Fuego/Electrate-Fuego)

2. Click "**Code**" then "**Download ZIP**" to your local computer.

3. Find this folder in your downloads. Move this folder to a secure place. You will return to this folder to manage your scripts and other assets like images, pdfs, etcetera.

4. For Mac, Windows, and Linux, download and/or open a code editor like [atom.io](https://atom.io) or any code editor of your choice. If you use a Chromebook O.S., we recommend Caret.

5. Use the code editor to open the **index.html** and **style.css** documents from your project folder.  

6. Start working with code by reading through the **index.html** where you'll find instructions on how to build your own web text!

7. Once you have modified and added your files to your project file, you will want to publish to the web. GitHub provides a good solution for "free." Create a GitHub account, then create a new repository for this webtext. Click  "uploading an existing file," (push) your files into this repository. You'll need ALL of your assets to make your webtext function properly. Upload assets, then hit "Commit changes."

8. Now go to your repository "**settings**." Scroll down and select "**Pages**" in the left hand menu. Change the source setting from "none" to "main." Hit "Save"

9. This will provide you with a published GitHub URL.

10. Test the URL in a browser. Magic, no? Actually, it's computer science.
